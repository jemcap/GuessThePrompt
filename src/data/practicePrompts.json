          "output": "SEATTLE - A breakthrough in renewable energy storage could make solar power available 24/7, as researchers at the University of Washington unveiled a new battery technology that stores energy for 30 days at 95% efficiency.\n\nThe zinc-air battery system, developed over five years by a team led by Dr. James Park, costs 80% less than current lithium-ion solutions and uses abundant, non-toxic materials.\n\n\"This changes everything for renewable energy adoption,\" said Dr. Park at yesterday's press conference. \"Communities can now store summer solar energy for winter use.\"\n\nThe technology has already attracted $100 million in venture funding and partnerships with three major utilities. Field trials begin next month in California, with commercial deployment expected by 2026.\n\nThe innovation addresses the biggest challenge facing renewable energy: intermittency.",

We analyzed 50,000 patient records from 2020-2024, applying BERT-based architectures fine-tuned on clinical notes.\n\nOur model achieved 94.2% accuracy in predicting diabetes onset within 2 years, outperforming traditional logistic regression (82.1%) and random forest models (87.3%). Feature importance analysis revealed medication history and lab results as primary predictors.\n\nThe model demonstrated robust performance across demographic groups, with F1 scores ranging from 0.91-0.95. These findings suggest transformer models can significantly enhance early disease detection in clinical settings.\n\nKeywords: machine learning, healthcare AI, transformers, predictive diagnostics",

We propose to:\n\n1. Collect longitudinal speech data from 1,000 participants\n2. Develop deep learning models for pattern recognition\n3. Validate findings through clinical trials\n4. Create open-source diagnostic toolkit\n\nRequested funding: $2.4M will support personnel (60%), equipment (20%), data collection (15%), and dissemination (5%).\n\nExpected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications, patent applications, and a validated screening tool with 85%+ accuracy.\n\nPI: Dr. Sarah Johnson, Neuroscience Department",
